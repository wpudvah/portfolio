                <h3>Tama Pudvah</h3>
                <h4>2014 Honda CR-V EX-L</h4>
                <p>My mother was looking to finally replace our 2004 Chrysler Pacifica, fondly dubbed "The Douchebag" by our family. After having such a difficult time maintaning and living with the Pacifica, Tama knew she wanted something reliable. But that's not all - it needed to be able to survive the harsh Minnesota winters, so it needed to be All-Wheel Drive. And of course, it needed to have the requisite heated seats. </p>
                <p>The search was simple - look for a reliable 4x4 SUV that could easily fit our family of four. Having read numerous raving reviews of Honda's latest iteration of their fabled CR-V crossover, it was a quick and easy process. We ended up getting the basically brand-new brown beast for $10k under MSRP - not bad!</p>
                <p> "The CR-V is running stronger than ever and survived it's first Minnesota winter this past year. I've loved every minute I've spent behind the wheel - especially with the heated seats! We got an amazing deal and I'm sure this car will be in the family until we run it into the ground." </p>

                <h3>Doug Pudvah</h3>
                <h4>1985 Porsche 911 Carrera Cabriolet</h4>
                <p>I am the biggest beneficiary of my father's mid-life crisis. This beautiful convertible sits in our garage and is my daily driver during the summers in Minneapolis. When my dad came to me and asked him to help him find a Porsche, I nearly fainted.</p>
                <p>I found this Stuttgart Stunner for sale in a nearby neighborhood. With barely over 50,000 miles on the clock, it was practically brand-new. Since purchasing the car in 2008, our family has enjoyed the pleasure of riding in this Porsche icon. </p>
                <p>"Well I don't drive it that much... mostly because [Willie] is usually behind the wheel! I've always loved the look ever since I was a kid, and finally got to realize my dream and purchase a Porsche 911. We got an amazing deal, and these cars are actually starting to appreciate in value, which is great!" </p>

                <h4>1999 Mazda MX-5 Miata</h4>
                <p>The Mazda Miata: the perennial two-seat sports car. When my neighbor Dr. Larson came to me to get suggestions for an afforadable sporty two-seater to enjoy on those beautiful Minnesota weekends, I immediately thought "Miata." There are an abundance of Miatas out there, you just gotta know where to find them. We were able to find this cherry red cabriolet in no-time. </p>
                <p>"I couldn't be happier with my Miata - it still drives like it's a brand-spanking-new sports car. I take it up north once or twice a summer and enter it into the local parade, it always gets a lot of smiles and thumbs-up! My wife loves it, my grandchildren love it, everyone loves it."
